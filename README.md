# :sushi: C# Password Security Test
A C# console application that determines the strength of a given password based on various criteria



## :signal_strength: Made with C# using the .NET framework

    
#### Please Note: 
    Just because you get a bad score on a password doesn't mean its entirely bad. 
    
    The password checker looks for special characters and character count to determine its score. 

    The Score reflects how random and hard to guess your password is
